- __What are islands of fertility?:__ Areas with high levels of nutrients and organic matter that form under canopy trees and shrubs in arid ecosystems.
- __Significance to the ecosystem:__ Islands help promote the persistence of shrubs in the community. Islands make plants resistant to environmental perturbations
- __How do are they formed?:__ Island formation can result from deposition of plant litter under canopies, soil erosion, rainsplash, nutrient “mining” from interspace soils, symbiotic nitrogen-fixing bacteria, and funneling nutrient-rich stemflow waters

Pictured below is an example of the dispersed vegtation patches that is characteristic of desert ecosystems.
